            Welcome to the new MVC Bootplate sample application. This app was
            designed to demonstrate the features of the new, optional
            <code>mvc</code> library, along with some other features being
            introduced in Enyo 2.2.
            </p>
            <p class="manual">
            The app is fully annotated; you can access the annotated source by
            selecting a file from the "Annotated Source" menu above.
            </p>
            <p class="manual">
            In the top portion of the app, <code>enyo.Binding</code> objects
            display data in real-time. You can edit existing records or add new
            ones to be displayed in the <code>Roller</code> by clicking the
            buttons in the top menu. Have fun and play around.
            </p>
            <p class="manual">
            Also notice the "Models" and "Showing" labels in the top toolbar.
            These are also examples of <code>enyo.Binding</code> in action. When
            you're done playing, be sure to take a look at the source code.
