<p>There can be multiple <code>enyo.Application</code>s running simultaneously
if you needed. In our case, we only need one. That being said the
concept of an <code>enyo.Application</code> is simple: coordinate startup and
initialization of a group of objects, if there is a view, render that
when appropriate.</p>       </section>       <section class="source">         <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">enyo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">kind</span><span class="p">({</span></pre></div>       </section>     </section>             <section class="group">       <section class="comments">         <p>While the namespace of the application is <code>Sample</code> the namespace

to initialize for this application at the <em>application scope</em>. This is
a <em>very important concept</em>. Notice the name properties of these
declarations and also note the namespace of this <em>kind</em>. Its <code>Sample</code>.
By default, the <code>enyo.Application</code> will attempt to create instances of
these controllers in the namespace of <em>the application kind that owns them</em>.
In our case, this means that when the application is created there should
immediately be available 2 controllers on the <code>Sample</code> object: <code>Sample.panels</code>
and <code>Sample.documents</code>. This allows any other objects in the application to
reference these controllers at those paths. It is possible to instantiate
them in a different namespace (or none at all) by setting a flag on these
declarations <code>global: true</code>. The application will not attempt to prefix the
<code>name</code> with the namespace of the given <em>kind</em>.</p>       </section>       <section class="source">         <div class="highlight"><pre>    <span class="nx">controllers</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
