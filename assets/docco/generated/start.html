initialized and is ready - thus ensuring the entirety of source
has been loaded. You can call <code>enyo.ready</code> and pass it a function
(and an optional context) as many times as you need and those method
will only execute once the <code>document</code> is completely ready.</p>       </section>       <section class="source">         <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">enyo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ready</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span></pre></div>       </section>     </section>             <section class="group">       <section class="comments">         <p>This is a very imporant declaration.
