<p>Some things need to happen only after the <code>document</code> has been fully
initialized--when we are sure that the entire source has been loaded.
You may call <code>enyo.ready</code> and pass it a function (and an optional
context) as many times as you need to and those methods will only be
executed once the <code>document</code> is completely ready.</p>       </div>       <div class="source">         <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">enyo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ready</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span></pre></div>       </div>     </div>             <div class="group">       <div class="comments">         <p>This is a very imporant declaration, in which we instantiate our
application. We arbitrarily assign the instance to a global
variable called <code>app</code>, in case we need to refer to it later. All
other components of this application are instantiated in the
<code>Sample</code> namespace. See the <code>apps/Sample.js</code> file for more
information on namespaces and what this actually means.</p>       </div>       <div class="source">         <div class="highlight"><pre>    <span class="nx">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Sample</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Application</span><span class="p">();</span></pre></div>       </div>     </div>             <div class="group">       <div class="comments">         <p>When our application renders for the first time, we want it to

ahead and render it to the DOM. We could have had the application
automatically render upon creation, but in <code>apps/Sample.js</code> we
deliberately told it not to do so. This gave us the opportunity
to prepare our scaffold data before the view layer was
initialized.</p>       </div>       <div class="source">         <div class="highlight"><pre>    <span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">render</span><span class="p">();</span>
