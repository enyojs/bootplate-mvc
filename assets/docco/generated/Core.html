<p>The idea behind the <code>main</code> function is similar to many other languages.
Think of this as the <code>main</code> starting place for the application -
all of the source that should be loaded has been (so all classes
are available in their namespaces) but the application
has not been executed. Use this method to effectively set up any global
objects that need to be instanced (say, for bindings in views) or other
programatic logic to perhaps load additional libraries if needed. You
can do anything in <code>main</code> really but ideally it can be used to set up
application-scoped objects/singletons - so that's what we've done in
this app.</p>       </section>       <section class="source">         <div class="highlight"><pre>    <span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">main</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

are sharing a single collection of models.
This is great but it can be tricky depending on what you
need to do with those models or the collection as a whole. In
our case, though, it's pretty straight-forward. We have a
<code>enyo.Collection</code> of models and some additional functionality
that is application specific.</p>

<p>Here we go ahead and instance <code>App.CollectionController</code> as a global
singleton. This means that anywhere from within the application
any string-path or hard-reference to <code>App.panels</code> will
be resolved to this object.</p>       </section>       <section class="source">         <div class="highlight"><pre>        <span class="nx">App</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">panels</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">App</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">PanelsController</span><span class="p">();</span></pre></div>       </section>     </section>             <section class="group">       <section class="comments">         <p>Here we create a singleton instance of another controller that is

<p>Here is an example of the <code>enyo.run</code> method. It allows us
to queue a function to be run <em>after the <code>main</code> function and
the <code>enyo.Application</code> startup methods have been run</em>. It is
<em>important to note the timing of execution of this method to
understand how to effectively use it</em>. Here we wanted to be able
to automatically add some <em>scaffolded models</em> (prepared models
from <code>Scaffold.js</code>) so we actually start with some data. Since the
<code>enyo.Application</code> has already been started that means that
controllers and views are already set up and listening for events.
Issuing these additions to the collection should trigger some
updates. It turns out for this initial batch we don't want that.</p>       </section>       <section class="source">         <div class="highlight"><pre>    <span class="nx">enyo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span></pre></div>       </section>     </section>             <section class="group">       <section class="comments">         <p>Let's add the <em>scaffolded models</em> using the proxied <code>add</code>
method of our panels controller. Note that we pass
an additional pararmeter of <code>silent: true</code> because we actually
do not want the event to fire notifying the view because the
default listener for the addition of models tries to take
us into the <code>isEditing</code> state. Instead, we supress the events
and arbitrarily issue an event from the controller because
the view (the <code>enyo.Panels</code>) is a listener from the controller.</p>       </section>       <section class="source">         <div class="highlight"><pre>        <span class="nx">App</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">panels</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">App</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Scaffold</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Roller</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">silent</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">});</span></pre></div>       </section>     </section>             <section class="group">       <section class="comments">         <p>Now we tell the Roller that we're ready by bubbling the event
