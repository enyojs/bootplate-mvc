<p>The editor is a view that is only visible when the application
state property (on <code>Sample.panels</code>) is set to true. This is only
the case when the "Edit" button is selected. By applying some CSS
(using LESS) we can create the effect of an overlay. With the
proper bindings, we can set up a text editor with hooks into the
modifiable content of the underlying record; proper bindings to
other views can give us real-time UI updates with no additional work.</p>       </section>       <section class="source">         <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">enyo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">kind</span><span class="p">({</span>

because it is owned by this view and has awareness of it. Because
we set the <code>controller</code> property to a kind instead of an instance,
the view automatically creates an instance of the controller.</p>

<p>All events from the view are propagated to the controller, which
may have its own named event handlers, listeners, and so on. If
a handler returns true, event propagation (bubbling) ends as
expected; if not, the event is routed right back up through the
view. This allows us to take non-view-related logic and graft it
onto a separate kind that has additional functionality.</p>       </section>       <section class="source">         <div class="highlight"><pre>    <span class="nx">controller</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Sample.EditorController&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span></pre></div>       </section>     </section>             <section class="group">       <section class="comments">         <p>We are able to create bindings with relative paths for both the
<code>from</code> and <code>to</code> properties. One thing to note is that the
controller is subkinded from <code>enyo.ModelController</code>--this allows
us to bind directly to properties of the controller as if it were
the model itself. It also means that we could make changes to the
model directly (or swap it out altogether) and those changes would
automatically propagate back to the view because of bindings.
Notice the explicit selection of target (<code>to</code>) properties. We bind
to the <code>content</code> property on the <code>label</code> child, but to the <code>value</code>
property on the <code>input</code> child.</p>       </section>       <section class="source">         <div class="highlight"><pre>    <span class="nx">bindings</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>

view for which we want to match the bounds. This is only necessary
due to limitations in the way the CSS is applied--this editor
becomes visible over the roller, but the roller's opacity changes.
In order to keep our opacity unaffected, we have a different parent,
but to match sizes we need to have a reference to the target view.
The layout finds the target in the value of <code>fitTarget</code>and sets our
bounds accordingly.</p>       </section>       <section class="source">         <div class="highlight"><pre>    <span class="nx">fitTarget</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;owner.$.roller&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
