// The Scaffolding
// ---------------
// We want there to be some messages in the roller when the user first
// sees it, so we create an array of sample records and add these to the
// collection during app startup. (You'll see this happen in `Core.js`.)
App.Scaffold = {
    "Roller": [
        {header: "Welcome to a new pattern of development in Enyo.js"},
        {header: "Make use of the new bindings, observers and notifications"},
        {header: "A model layer as strong as Backbone.js"}
    ]
};
