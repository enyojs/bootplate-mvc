// current dimensions of another _view_ that was not directly
// in its own tree. Using the logic behind `enyo.getPath` we
// can easily abstract this desire to something that is
// reuseable for other objects. On the _view_ implementing the
// `App.FitToTargetBounds` _layoutKind_ simply have a property
// `fitTarget` that can be a string path (relative to the _view_)
// or a full path to an instance or an object reference.
