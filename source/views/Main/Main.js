// The `Sample.Main` kind
// -------------------
// This is the main presentation portion of the application. We place
// all the content for the app in a vertical scroller. The presentation
// is then broken down further into conveniently-named parts. While it
// isn't always necessary to break out each view into its own kind,
// it's generally a good idea to do so for any section that has specific
// behavior or needs to encapsulate behavior beneath it by providing
// scope-relevant bindings to its children.
enyo.kind({
    // Notice that we use our application namespace for this kind.
    name: "Sample.Main",
    kind: "enyo.Scroller",

    // One useful feature of bindings is the ability to do
    // "transforms"--conversions of data types such that different values
    // exist on each end of the binding. However, sometimes you can achieve
    // the same effect without the transform, simply by binding the
    // appropriate type.
    //
    // In the current example, we bind a state property of the panels
    // controller (the boolean `isEditing`) to the `showing` property of
    // one of our child views (`editor`). This causes the `editor` child
    // to only be visible when `isEditing` is set to true.

        // two-way binding in another component.
