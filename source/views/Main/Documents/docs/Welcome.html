                Welcome to the new <em>MVC bootplate</em> sample application. This application was designed to help show some of the new features being added in <em>Enyo.js 2.2</em> as well as those provided by the new, optional <em>mvc</em> library. While we couldn't detail every line of code or feature added to the framework, this entire app is fully annotated and you can access the annotated source by selecting a file from the <em>Annotated Source</em> button on the menu above.

                There are a few things to note when using this application. The top portion is fully interactive! It displays the use of <code>enyo.Binding</code>s in real-time. You can <em>edit</em> and <em>add</em> new records to be displayed in the <em>Roller</em> by clicking the buttons in the top menu. Have fun and play around. Also notice the <em>Models</em> and <em>Showing</em> labels in the top toolbar. These are also examples of using <code>enyo.Binding</code>s. When you're done playing have a look at the source.
