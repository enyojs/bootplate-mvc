<p>The idea behind the <code>main</code> function is similar to many other languages.
Think of this as the <code>main</code> starting place for the application -
all of the source that should be loaded has been (so all classes are
are available in the namespaces they should be) but the application
has not been executed. Use this method to effectively setup any global
objects that need to be instanced (say, for bindings in views) or other
programatic logic to perhaps load additional libraries if needed. You
can do anything in <code>main</code> really but ideally we setup application-scoped
objects/singletons - so that's what we've done in this app.</p>       </section>       <section class="source">         <div class="highlight"><pre>    <span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">main</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

are sharing a single collection of models throughout the app.
This is both awesome and can be tricky depending on what you
need to do with those models or the collection as a whole. In
our case, though, its pretty straight-forward. We have a
<code>enyo.Collection</code> of models and some additional functionality
that is application specific.</p>

<p>So you can take a look at the source for the <code>Mvc.CollectionController</code>
class, and right here we go ahead and instance it as a global
singleton. This means that anywhere from within the application
any string-path or hard-reference to <code>Mvc.controller</code> it will
be resolved to this object.</p>       </section>       <section class="source">         <div class="highlight"><pre>        <span class="nx">enyo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">singleton</span><span class="p">({</span></pre></div>       </section>     </section>             <section class="group">       <section class="comments">         <p>The name of the global/application-scoped singleton is lower-case

<p>Here is an example of the <code>enyo.run</code> method that allows us
to queue a function to be run <em>after the <code>main</code> function and
the <code>enyo.Application</code> startup methods have been run</em>. It is
<em>important to note the timing of execution of this method to
understand how to effectively use it</em>. Here we wanted to be able
to automatically add some <em>scaffolded models</em> (prepared models
from <code>Scaffold.js</code>) so we actually start with some data. Since the
<code>enyo.Application</code> has already been started that means that
controllers and views are already setup and listening for events.
Issuing these additions to the collection should trigger some
updates, it turns out, for this initial batch we don't want that.</p>       </section>       <section class="source">         <div class="highlight"><pre>    <span class="nx">enyo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span></pre></div>       </section>     </section>             <section class="group">       <section class="comments">         <p>Lets add the <em>scaffolded models</em> using the proxied <code>add</code>

an additional pararmeter of <code>silent: true</code> because we actually
do not want the event to fire notifying the view because the
default listener for the addition of models tries to take
us into the <code>isEditing</code> state. Instead, we supress the events
and arbitrarily issue an event from the controller because
the view (the <code>enyo.Panels</code>) is a listener from the controller.</p>       </section>       <section class="source">         <div class="highlight"><pre>        <span class="nx">Mvc</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">controller</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">Mvc</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Scaffold</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Roller</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">silent</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">});</span></pre></div>       </section>     </section>             <section class="group">       <section class="comments">         <p>Now we tell the Roller that we're ready by bubbling the event
